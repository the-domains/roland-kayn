Basically, Kayn would design networks of electronic equipment and then develop a system of signals and commands that it could obey and execute. Words like \"melody\", \"harmony\" and \"rhythm\" do not apply to Kayn's music. Music, supposedly, should have every detail defined by the composer. Kayn insisted that his \"cybernetic\" music should regulate itself, thereby relinquishing the narrative elements and the psycho-emotional details usually associated with the ideas of \"authorship\" and \"work of art\". This meant that even he could not predict the eventual composition, which were sound processes without an epicentre, where every sound is equally important. For Kayn, \"Music is sound, which is sufficient in itself\". Roland Kayn feels that present day composers should avail themselves of the electronic techniques at their disposal and that electronic music is more than just the result of rapidly expanding technology."},{"id":"9479094a-0cf4-43c7-8774-9f3dfccc93c2","item":"8972817b-fc80-43ad-9ef3-22ff115b2fbc","type":"text","html":"<p>- <em>Frans van
